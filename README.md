This is a modified version of the Path of Exile Lutbot AutoHotkey Macro where the 'Paste' option is added allowing you to hotkey sending messages from the clipboard.

For setup and usage instructions refer to the [original version](http://lutbot.com/).

**This setup is deprecated in favor of using [POE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro) with [custom macros](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro/wiki/Custom-Macros) such as `F2::SendInput {Enter}^v{Enter}`.**
